This is a template I have created of a portfolio webpage. It was made using bootstrap in html and references bootstrap stylesheets. Processes involved creating a functional navbar to navigate between pages, using bootstrap grid system to position elements, and creating a responsive webpage for different viewports. 

The goal of the project is to match the layout and features of the example images provided.
