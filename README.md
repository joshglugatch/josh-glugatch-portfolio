# Portfolio Demo
This is a template I have created of a portfolio webpage. It was made using bootstrap in html and references a bootstrap cdn. Processes involved creating a functional navbar to navigate between pages, using bootstrap grid system to position elements, and maintain aesthetic in dynamic viewports. 

The goal of the template is to match the layout and features of the example images provided.
